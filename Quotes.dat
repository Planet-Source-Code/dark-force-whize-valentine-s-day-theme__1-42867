If I had a wish,
I would be your tears, 
To be born in your eyes 
And to die on your lips,

But if you were my tears,
I would never cry,
In fear of losing you!
                                
Love will not appear in command by one's heart,
But will reveal itself one way or another unexpectedly.
                                                                                              
To wish is to wish for you,
To sleep is to dream of you,
To live is to wait for you,
To smile is to think of you.
                                                                                  
Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a strike of luck.                                                                                                                                  
Love, like a dome of many-colored glass 
Stains the white radiance of eternity.                                                                                                                        
Never close your lips to those
Whom you have opened your heart.
